4/18/2018 I am trying to undestand Allegro. I had some issues downloading it. Currently trying to figure out how to use it.
Since I am still trying to learn how to use Allegro, I created an outline with a general idea of how I want my code to look 
a what methods I might wants to use. I tried using code from Snake but I am not sure what Allegro provides me with so that
part is incomplete because it is missing multiple components that Snake had but I am still trying to figure it out.
I also have empty images that I will later use in my game once I figure out how to incorporate 
them. I created a simple main by using Allegro to generate a window that says "Frogger".
I know that there is not a lot done but I am currently researching and trying to figure out how to use Allegro. Once that is done, 
it will be a lot easier for me to start writing actual code for the game.

4/23 I created an image of a road and was able to display it with Allegro. My next step is to create a sprite which would be my frog and be able to display it and eventually move it.
