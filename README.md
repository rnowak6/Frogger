# CS 126 FinalProject

Welcome to my game of Frogger.
The goal of the game is to cross through lanes of traffic to the other side without getting hit.
Use the arrow keys to move across the screen. Every time your frog moves, it makes a sound. But be careful!
There are cars going in different directions and won't stop for your frog. If you get hit, the game plays a sad sound and you lost
so the game is over. If you reach the other side without getting hit, happy music is played and you just won this awesome game of
Frogger.

This game was built using Allegro, a gaming library and the game also used open frameworks to add sound. It allows the user to 
interact with the game by using arrow keys. The game uses collision detection to check if the frog was hit by a car. If the frog 
is hit, it ends the game. Another way to end the game is by winnning the game. This version of Frogger was made in Visual Studio 
using Allegro and Open Frameworks.
